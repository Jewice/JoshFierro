# Hi 👋, I'm Josh

### Data Analyst | ML & Neural Computation graduate | Neuroscience researcher contributing to Alzheimer's studies

I’ve always loved puzzles—the kind where pieces seem unrelated until suddenly everything clicks. To me, data analysis feels like that same thrill, but amplified: technology so advanced it borders on magic. Pulling together disparate bits of information, spotting hidden patterns, and delivering insights **with real confidence** to guide decisions? That's powerful, and I'm hooked on building that skill every day.

Currently, I'm applying ML and data techniques in a neuroscience lab, helping analyze data for Alzheimer's research. Outside of work, I'm drawn to financial markets, a fascinating representation of collective of human knowledge, innovation, and competition. I enjoy blending fundamentals with technicals to understand true drivers (principled analysis in search of alpha).

I'm on a continuous learning journey: I don't claim to know everything, but I'm committed to growing, shipping projects, and turning curiosity into impact. Excited to connect and collaborate!

- 🔭 Currently working on: Neuroscience data pipelines + personal market analysis projects
- 🌱 Learning & leveling up: Advanced Pandas/SQL workflows, Tableau dashboards, ML for real-world insights
- 💬 Ask me about: Data storytelling, pattern hunting in complex datasets, or transitioning ML skills to analyst roles
- 📫 Reach out: www.linkedin.com/in/joshua-fierro-20165b19b (feel free to message about opportunities!)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once tried to model my coffee intake like market volatility... results were caffeinated chaos

### 🛠️ Skills & Tools
- **Core:** Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, Excel/Google Sheets
- **Visualization:** Tableau, Matplotlib/Seaborn
- **ML/Analysis Techniques:** Data cleaning, EDA, statistical modeling, neural nets
- **Other:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git, domain exposure in neuroscience & finance

### 📊 Featured Projects (OCR!)
These are the ones I mentioned—I'll add repos, code, notebooks, and dashboards as I migrate them here.

- **Alzheimer's Neuroscience Analysis** — Applied ML/data techniques to study progression patterns (details + code coming)
- **Financial Markets Exploration** — Combined fundamental & technical analysis on select datasets to uncover drivers (principled, not speculative)
- **Other Portfolio Pieces** — EDA on public datasets, dashboard builds, puzzle-like insight projects

More repos pinned below once live. Stay tuned—I'm actively building!
